	<p>The previous devlog is available <a href="https://programmingpixels.com/fly-everything-devlog-1-control-schemes.html">here</a></p>
<p>I started trying to add more object types to the game as well as a very basic menu system that would be useful for testing during development. Like the prototype, touching anything other than platforms will kill the drone, there's a large orange barrier in the centre of the level and I fenced the whole screen in with a kill barrier around the edge.</p>

<p>One of the key differences I wanted between this and the game jam game that inspired it was larger levels. To accomplish that I'd need to have a camera able to follow the drone around a larger level. The game is supposed to have more of a problem solving feel than an action/ adventure title so I made a little camera zoom intro that shows the player the whole level before they start.</p>

<p>Moving platforms seem to be working correctly now but they were a real pain again. The theory sounds simple, when the drone lands on the platform, move the drone with platform.</p>
<p>I may make a godot tutorial in the future to cover moving platforms because it doesn't seem to be a well covered topic. I have a few added complications here that I think most games don't have to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms can move in any direction.</li>
<li>It's only safe for the drone's feet to touch the platform. If any other part of the drone touches it then the drone is considered to have crashed.</li>
<li>Making contact with only one foot is considered a crash.</li>
</ul>
