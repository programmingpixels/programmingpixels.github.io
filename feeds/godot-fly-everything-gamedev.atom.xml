I had the idea that the drone could be controlled with a single touch on the screen by having the drone fly towards the location of the touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User testing uncovered a number of problems though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because gravity is constantly pulling the drone down, the player need to touch somewhere above the drone every second or so to prevent it falling to the bottom of the screen. This means that the players hand often blocks their view of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't easily navigate around the top section of the screen as you need to touch above the drone to maintain it's height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's uncomfortable to have to hold a phone/ tablet with a single hand which the player is required to do as one hand needed to touch anywhere on the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle these problems I changed to a safer and more familiar control layout and add buttons to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video alt="control scheme video 2" class="videoborder onebyone" autoplay loop&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with button style controls on a touchscreen is the lack of tactile feedback. When you use a console controller you're constantly receiving feedback through your thumbs about where they are on the controller- if you miss a button you can feel that you haven't pressed anything. You don't have that on a touch screen though. To counter this, I've actually made the effective button area much much larger than the button images on the screen. Touching anywhere in the shaded blue area will actually trigger the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully progress on new features will be rapid now I've settled on a control scheme.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="godot"></category><category term="gamedev"></category></entry><entry><title>Fly Everything devlog #0</title><link href="https://programmingpixels.com/fly-everything-devlog-0.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-15T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-15T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Danny Barthaud</name></author><id>tag:programmingpixels.com,2019-10-15:/fly-everything-devlog-0.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm going to develop a game made for a game jam into a full-blown mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month I had a lot of fun doing a game jam, you can read about the game and my experiences &lt;a href="https://programmingpixels.com/drone-pilot-lowrezjam-2019.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to take the concept and turn it into a full-blown mobile game. I'll be doing devlogs here but they'll probably lag a little behind my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/prog_pixels"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; where it's easier to post short updates so follow me on there if you want to keep up to date with the latest developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into mobile development, I decided to go back and add an extra 'final' level to the prototype. The whole game is completely free to download for windows and linux on &lt;a href="https://programmingpixels.itch.io/drone-pilot-lowrezjam"&gt;itch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="safe landing" src="https://programmingpixels.com/images/dronedevlog0/lvl9.gif" class="twobytwo" &gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Just publish it to mobile stores then&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the support for getting pygame applications onto mobile platforms is limited. There are libraries out there that would help get it onto android but from what I've read support for ios is lacking. Pygame is a great tool and obviously by using it you have the power of python and its extensive collection of 3rd party libraries. In this case though building a small game targeting mobile first, it seems like &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/"&gt;Godot&lt;/a&gt; would be a much more sensible choice. It has a lot of built in support for deployments to mobile platforms and rebuilding what I've already done in python will only take a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's pretty small even for a mobile game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't created a game for mobile for quite a few years so it'll be good to get the ball rolling again with something small but I do have a number of improvements in mind. Firstly, the working title is 'Fly Everything'- I want to include three or four aircraft types (like stunt planes and space shuttles) including my original drones. A rough wishlist looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More aircraft types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved artwork and animations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher resolutions than 64x64.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 10 levels for each aircraft type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larger levels so that the camera will have to move to follow your aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many more obstacle types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A choice of intuitive touch screen control methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a huge project and even though I'm going to improve the artwork, I'll be keeping it quite basic. The target for release is November 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="godot"></category><category term="gamedev"></category></entry></feed>
