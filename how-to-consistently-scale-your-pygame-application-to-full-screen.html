	<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>While working on a game for the recent <a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2019">lowrez game jam</a> I noticed pygame exhibiting some strange behaviour. My game ran correctly in window mode but when I switched to full screen the aspect ratio wasn't right. My square game window hadn't maintained it's original aspect ratio at full screen (which would have created black bars at the side of a square game window), nor had it been fully stretched to take up all of my widescreen monitor. It has done something in between instead, creating black bars at the sides of my game that were an incorrect size.</p>
<p>To help investigate the problem, I wrote a very basic python script that uses pygame to draw a square in the top left area of the screen. I found that 16:9 monitors seemed to display a range of resolutions correctly while monitors with other aspect ratios (mine is 16:10) displayed rectangles instead of squares. (This was tested across windows and linux mint and several completely different monitors and machines running a mix of AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards).</p>
<p><img alt="monitor image" src="./images/fscrerror/samsung.jpg">

<p>[show script]</p>
<p>Generally I've found that pygame's default fullscreen method doesn't reliably maintain your game's aspect ratio and may do something somewhat unpredictable.
The first monitor detects a 1280x1024 resolutions do not match the native resolutions of these monitors, they should be supported well enough to draw the square correctly (pygame.display.list_modes() reports that 1280x1024 is a supported mode). If I set windows to a 1280x1024 resolution then in paint's squares (shift + rectangle tool) come out as perfect squares.</p>
<p>This is disappointing because we want to know our application's aspect ratio is going to be correctly maintained for a range of different setups and displays. </p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>One solution is to use pygame's <em>[scale]</em>(https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/transform.html#pygame.transform.scale) method to scale our game surface up to match the resolution height of the monitor and then blit this surface to the correct location on a native resolution screen object.</p>
<p>[show script]</p>

<p>This method is versatile and should work for all resolutions and screen orientations (landscape or portrait). In my timing tests in a few games I've written, this scaling takes around 2ms each frame on my modest machine (in a 60fps game, you have 16.67ms per frame). Pygame's fullscreen default stretching that we were using first also seems to be limited in its ability to stretch resolutions, maybe up to a factor of 2. It means I needed to use this scale function for my low res game (to scale 64x64 up to modern screen resolutions) and also, if you make a game and want to support the popular laptop screen resolution (1366x900 ??) then you won't want to make your game greater than 900 pixels high. But you can't scale that all the way to 4k using pygame's default fullscreen functionality.</p>
<p>This method allows you to work with pygame in a quite straight forward and obvious way. A more complicated approach would be to </p>
