	<p>How do we get pixel perfect sprites into games without stretching, cropping or otherwise deforming them?
This is a tricky topic and there are a few solutions across the internet. In this blog post I want to introduce another versatile method that should be implementable in a number of different frameworks. I've implemented the solution in a small amount of <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> using <a href="https://www.pygame.org">pygame</a> which should be digestable to anyone with some programming experience (it will be well explained as we build up a solution).</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>The problem with using sprites on a range of resolutions is well explained in this stackoverflow discussion <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35785291/getting-giggly-effect-when-slowly-moving-a-sprite">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35785291/getting-giggly-effect-when-slowly-moving-a-sprite</a> as well as on this blog <a href="https://weareludicrous.com/blog/2018/pixel-sharp-graphics-at-multiple-screen-resolutions/">https://weareludicrous.com/blog/2018/pixel-sharp-graphics-at-multiple-screen-resolutions/</a> but basically you spend hours making your pixel art perfect, every pixel's colour is meticulously selected but when you release your game and it's stretched and skewed across different resolutions (so many resolutions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution#/media/File:Vector_Video_Standards.svg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution#/media/File:Vector_Video_Standards.svg</a>).</p>
<p>Avoiding stretching pixel and boarders</p>
<h2>A Solution</h2>
<p>The solution comes in two parts, first we need to do some maths to work out what sprites sizes we should create to support the maximum number of resolutions without resorting to resizing our sprites on the fly.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/">steam survey</a> 16:9 monitor resolutions (eg. 1920x1080) are the most common, so we'll start with a specialised solution for 16:9.</p>
<p>Separate game units from our resolution, let's say our game has a resolution of 19,200x10,800 </p>
<p>Secondly, we write some code to determine on startup which sprites to use and to size our game area.</p>
<h2>A basic platformer to help illustrate the problem</h2>
<p>I've written an extremely basic platformer.
In this game</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is one solution to a common problem in game development. There may be others that fit your requirements better but this general solution is quite versatile and should be implementable in many game engines.</p>
